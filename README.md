##Summary

First off, angular is awesome. What would have taken an entire weekend of programming and testing can now be done in a fraction of the time. The training in tunely and the book app went smoothly given our familiarity with handlebars and ajax. I'm excited to learn more about angular in the near future.

You're on the starter-wdi34 branch! These instructions are for WDI34!

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this training, developers will be able to:*

- display data in an angular app.
- use `$http` to access a RESTful API.

Deliberate practice is a really effective way to build skills. You've learned about a lot of key pieces of an Angular app, and now it's time to put those pieces together.  You'll be expected to be able to build an Angular app with from a skeleton that controls client-side routes.

### Overview

In this lab, you'll be creating a simple library app to keep track of books.

When a user goes to `/`, they should see a list of all of the books in the API. When a user goes to `/books/:id`, they should see a single book. On the `/books/:id` page, a user should be able to edit or delete a book.

Your data (a list of books) is available at `https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/books`. You and your classmates will all be working with the shared API; keep that in mind as you make changes.  If there are no books left or far too many books, feel free to reset the database by clicking [the reset button](http://super-crud.herokuapp.com/reset). Don't do this without warning your colleagues, though. They might be puzzled why their newly created book resources aren't appearing in the database.

### Expectations

Your finished product will:

  1. Route the user to an index page at `/`. That page will:
    * display all of the books.
    * show the image, title, author, and release date of each book.
    * include a link to the show book page on the title of each book.
  2. Route the user to a show book page at `/books/:id` for any existing book id. The show page will:
    * display all of the data about the specific book.
    * have a delete button that deletes the specific book from the database and, when successfully deleted, redirects the user to the home page.
    * have an edit button that reveals a form for the user to edit the attributes of the book.
    * The edit form will have a save button that sends the edits to the database and, when successfully updated, redirects the user to the home page.
    * have a cancel button that does not save any of the changes the user just made when editing.

### This Repo's Structure

There are two branches in this repo that you might want to pay attention to: `starter-wdi34` and `solutions`.

The `master` branch is for a different version of this lab.

The `starter-wdi34` branch has most of the basic parts of the app set up, with some comments to help you as you build out the project. It also has client-side routing in place. (If you run it as is, you will see errors!)

The `solutions` branch has a fully built-out application that meets all the expectations above. Reference it if you're really stuck, but remember you may have your app set up differently!



### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Change directories into `angular-books-crud-lab`.
3. **Move to the `starter-wdi34` branch, then create a branch for your work!**
4. Since this app uses Angular's client-side routing,  the app will need to be served from a simple server. **Run `budo --pushstate --host=localhost --open` from the Terminal (inside your project directory).** This starts a simple server that by default will serve up your `index.html` on `/` and any route it doesn't recognize (like `/books`)!  Note: Your `index.html` *must* be in your main project directory for this server setup.
4. Take inventory of the provided code - what do you see in the browser console when you visit the site?

### Tips

* Commit frequently!

* The books API is set up with RESTful routes, so follow RESTful routing conventions.  You can test endpoints with Postman or cURL, or by setting up a simple request to trigger them.
* Look at (`console.log`) the data you get back from each `$http` request!
* If you want to change the page url from within a controller, you'll have to interact with the routing setup a little. Inject the [`$location`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$location) service into your controller, and use its `path` method. You will probably want to do this with the BooksShowController, so `$location` is included there.

      ```js  
      // inside GoatsShowController, we want to send the user back to goats index (home page) automatically
      $location.path('/');
      ```
      </details>

### Stretch Challenges

2. **Allow the user to edit the book image:** allow the user to change the URL for the book image.
3. **Add filters to organize the books index page:** add a search bar to filter the books by your search, or buttons to sort them alphabetically by author name or book title.
1. **Allow the user to add a book:** add a form on the index page that lets a user enter information for a new book.  Read the [super CRUD API documentation](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/super-crud-api) documentation or code to see what fields you need to send in the request body.
